You are a document classifier.

Document:
"""{{document}}"""

ASA Definitions:
"""{{asa_definitions}}"""

Task: Classify the document into a single ASA code based on the definitions provided.
Choose the most relevant code that fits the document content. If no relevant code is found return NULL with
the explanation of "No code was relevant"

Return your answer as strictly valid JSON only, with this exact format (no extra text before or after):

{
  "code": "<ASA code>", 
  "Explanation": "<a short explanation why this code fits>"
}

Notes:
- The "code" field must be ONLY the numerical ASA code, e.g. "5.1.2" or "4.11".
- The code consists only of digits and dots as separators.
- The code must exist in the supplied ASA Definitions, do not make up a code that is not listed
- Only output the JSON object. No extra commentary.

Examples:
{
"code": "51.1.2",
"Explanation": "This is a description of how the code matches this choice."
}
