You are a document classifier.

Document:
"""{{document}}"""

Candidate codes with similarity scores:
"""{{candidates}}"""

Task: Pick the single best code from the list above considering the similarity score that has been assigned.

Return your answer as strictly valid JSON only, with this exact format (no extra text before or after):

{
  "code": "<ASA code>", 
  "Explanation": "<a short explanation why this code fits>"
}

Notes:
- The "code" field must be ONLY the numerical ASA code, e.g. "5.1.2" or "4.11".
- The code consists only of digits and dots as separators.
- The code must exist in the supplied ASA Definitions, do not make up a code that is not listed
- Only output the JSON object. No extra commentary.
